# Color Palette
The Color Palette allows you to create a palette from 2 to 10 color tiles. You can choose a specific color for each tile, move then, delete, and add tiles. To build this app I used vanilla(plain) JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. During the work on this project, I learned:

1. How create a tooltip that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element
2. How to implement drag and drop functionality.
3. About a color picker and how to change colors by using input[type="color"].

## Things to improve:
1. Generate related colours rather than random (e.g. ascending lightness, complementary hues etc)
2. Improve the "add tile" functionality to create a new tile after the current tile.
3. Set the background color of the newly added tile as a mix of the two nearest tiles.
4. Save palettes to localStorage.
